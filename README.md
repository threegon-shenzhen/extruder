00-0756-com update
we have revised the 00-0756-com adding 2 ribs to hold the the ribbon connector. I have attached the lastest drawing . also we’ll update it in Github later 
We will need to add an airgap between the connector and the ribs.  The connector needs atleast 3mm of travel to become disconnected, so a gap ~1mm would be safe.  I do want to avoid putting any compression force against the top of the connector and accidentally forcing the pins on the underside to ground on the aluminum plate below
Hi Jerry  and Allen 
 
Understand now,the gap is 1mm between the connector and the ribs we have made.therefor,we’ll update the CAD to you with Github,ok?
